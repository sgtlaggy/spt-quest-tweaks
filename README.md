# sgtlaggy's Quest Tweaks

## Reveal All Quest Objectives

Reveal all objectives that are hidden by default and only show up after completing other objectives.

One example is Broadcast - Part 1, the objective to place the Signal Jammer doesn't appear until you've entered the room.

## Reveal Unknown Quest Rewards

Replace all "Unknown Reward" quest rewards with the actual items.

## Remove Time Gates

Remove waiting periods after some quests like Gunsmith.

## Remove Tedious Conditions

The following objective conditions can be removed:

- Elimination target (PMC, scav, boss, etc)
- Weapon and mods
- Equipment
- Health/status effects (stun, dehydration)
- Body parts
- Distance
- Time
- Map/location
- Zone
  - Removing zone but not map conditions will expand it to the map.
- Item found-in-raid status

## Add Missing Setup Shotguns

The Setup quest requires an MP-series shotgun but this does not include the MP-43 sawed-off double barrel or MP-18 by default.

Rant: The MP-18 is classified as a shotgun in-game due to Russian law classifying all smooth-bore rifles as such. By that logic, the .366 rifles (VPO-209 and VPO-215) should also be classified as shotguns but they are not.

## Only Require Level to start Lightkeeper

This option will remove all the prerequisite quests to start `Network Provider - Part 1` and will only require a specific level. A value of `0` will disable this feature and leave the prerequisites in place.
