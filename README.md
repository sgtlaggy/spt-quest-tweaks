# sgtlaggy's Quest Tweaks

## Reveal All Quest Objectives

Reveal all objectives that are hidden by default and only show up after completing other objectives.

One example is Broadcast - Part 1, the objective to place the Signal Jammer doesn't appear until you've entered the room.

## Reveal Unknown Quest Rewards

Replace all "Unknown Reward" quest rewards with the actual items.

## Remove Time Gates

Remove waiting periods after some quests like Gunsmith.

## Remove Tedious Conditions

The following objective conditions can be removed:

- Elimination target (PMC, scav, boss, etc)
- Weapon and mods
- Equipment
- Health/status effects (stun, dehydration)
- Body parts
- Distance
- Time
- Map/location
- Zone
  - Removing zone but not map conditions will expand it to the map.
- Item found-in-raid status

## Only Require Level to start Lightkeeper

This option will remove all the prerequisite quests to start `Network Provider - Part 1` and will only require a specific level. A value of `0` will disable this feature and leave the prerequisites in place.

## Add AA12 to Claustrophobia
Claustrophobia, like Setup in earlier versions, is missing the AA12 (both Gen 1 and Gen 2) from the list of shotguns you can use to kill in the Factory cellars.

## Add Grenade Launchers to Grenadier
Grenadierâ€™s weapon list includes several unimplemented launchers, but none that are functional. This will make the FN40GL, MSGL, GP-25, and M203 kills count toward it.

## Add Sako TRG M10 to Tarkov Shooter 1-6
BSG only added it to 7 and 8, this option makes it work for 1-6 as well.
