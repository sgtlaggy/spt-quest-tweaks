# Gunsmith Challenge

Inspired by [SheefGG](https://www.twitch.tv/SheefGG)'s hardcore gunsmith challenge.

This adds an Elimination objective for each weapon in the Gunsmith questline. These requirements are rather relaxed and don't *exactly* match the builds. As a result, ammo weight and stat differences from mods like [Realism](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/606-spt-realism-mod/) shouldn't affect viability. More specifically, it only checks for the correct weapon and any explicitly requested mods.

By default 5 PMC kills are required. This value can be changed in `config/config.json`.
