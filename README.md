# sgtlaggy's Quest Tweaks

## Reveal All Quest Objectives

Reveal all objectives that are hidden by default and only show up after completing other objectives.

One example is Broadcast - Part 1, the objective to place the Signal Jammer doesn't appear until you've entered the room.

## Reveal Unknown Quest Rewards

Replace all "Unknown Reward" quest rewards with the actual items.

## Remove Time Gates

Remove waiting periods after some quests like Gunsmith.

## Remove Tedious Conditions

The following objective conditions can be removed:

- Elimination target (PMC, scav, boss, etc)
- Weapon and mods
- Equipment
- Health/status effects (stun, dehydration)
- Body parts
- Distance
- Time
- Map/location
- Zone
  - Removing zone but not map conditions will expand it to the map.
- Item found-in-raid status

An additional setting toggles whether these also apply to repeatable quests.

The `exemptQuests` setting lets you specify a list of quests conditions will *not* be removed from. This should be a list of quest IDs, which can be found by searching the quest name in `SPT_Data/Server/database/locales/global/en.json` and looking for a matching line starting with `"<QUEST ID> name"`. For example, the ID of the dehydration quest "The Survivalist Path - Zhivchik" is `5d25bfd086f77442734d3007`. This can be added to the list like `["5d25bfd086f77442734d3007"]`. To add multiple quests, add a comma between ids like `["...", "..."]`.
Modded quests can also be added. Their quest IDs can be found in some file in their own mod folder in `user/mods` or, if they use VCQL, `user/mods/Virtual's Custom Quest Loader/database/locales/en/THAT_TRADER.json`.

## Set Number For Eliminations and Items to Hand Over

These options will set a specific value for all quests to use when requiring kills or item turn-ins, respected by ‘exemptQuests‘ list.

The item setting does not apply to quest items like the Bronze Pocket Watch or keys/keycards.

## Only Require Level to start Lightkeeper

This option will remove all the prerequisite quests to start `Network Provider - Part 1` and will only require a specific level. A value of `0` will disable this feature and leave the prerequisites in place.

## Add Sako TRG M10 to Tarkov Shooter 1-6

BSG only added it to 7 and 8, this option makes it work for 1-6 as well.
